## How to create a new tracker

## How to update the [Broncos Sacks Tracker](http://www.denverpost.com/2016/09/14/denver-broncos-sack-tracker-2016/) for a new year

1. Open the shared Sports spreadsheet
2. Create two new tabs: broncos-sacks-YEAR and broncos-sacks-by-player-YEAR
3. The layout for the new tabs should look like the previous years' sheets.
4. Add a row (insert it in row 2) in the broncos-sacks-per-season for the new year, give it a value of 0.
5. Copy the previous year's html file (such as [blob/master/www/broncos-sacks-2016.html](blob/master/www/broncos-sacks-2016.html) and edit these lines:
  * [The title element](blob/master/www/broncos-sacks-2016.html#L7)
  * [Each instance of the article URL in the head](blob/master/www/broncos-sacks-2016.html#L9)
  * [Each instance of the old year in the body](blob/master/www/broncos-sacks-2016.html#L151)
6. Add the new html file to the repo, upload it to extras (in the app folder, in stat-tacker).
7. SSH to prod, cd to the project directory, activate the virtual env and run ./deploy.bash
